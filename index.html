<p>As parents we’re not alone. Here are some words of wisdom from parents who’ve been there and done that.</p><blockquote><p>Your kids require you most of all to love them for who they are, not to spend your whole time trying to correct them. - <em>Bill Ayers</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Your children need your presence more than your presents. - <em>Jesse Jackson</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We spend the first 12 months of our children’s lives teaching them to walk and talk and the next 12 months teaching them to sit down and shut up. - <em>Phyllis Diller</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don’t worry that children never listen to you; worry that they are always watching you. -<em> Robert Fulghum</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Never do for a child what he is capable of doing for himself. - <em>Elizabeth Hainstock</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Everybody knows how to raise children, except the people who have them.<br>- <em>P. J. O'Rourke</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are apt to forget that children watch examples better than they listen to preaching. ~ <em>Roy L. Smith</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Children are our second chance to have a great parent-child relationship. ~ <em>Laura Schlessinger</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Where parents do too much for their children, the children will not do much for themselves. ~ Elbert Hubbard</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve come across some good quotes on parenting, please do share by leaving a comment.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="16"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="17"><h1>Surviving a Heart Attack - a month later</h1><p>If you’ve been catching up on my previous posts,<a href="http://tumblr.vinuthomas.com/post/120435295353/second-lease-of-life">after my close brush with death</a>, I’ve been trying to making some changes.

<h2>Food</h2><p>As part of the low fat of the diet, I’m on a ration of 20ml of oil for an entire month - there go all the fried foods! Cheese, processed meats, mayo, butter and most of the other food items have suddenly disappeared from the table. The low sodium part means the rest of the food which I can eat tends to be slightly bland. I shall stop ranting about the food, because the side effect of this is that I’ve ended up losing close to 10kgs over the past month - with minimal exercising.</p><p>To get over the 2 teaspoon per day quota and still have tasty food, I went ahead and got a <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.in%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB009UOR7KI%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D3626%26creative%3D24822%26creativeASIN%3DB009UOR7KI%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dmyporwor-21%26linkId%3DYUZZ2OGG7QTHO6SV&amp;t=MmIyZDM1MzdhODE2ODU2OTJkYTVkNTY3NmQ4ZTUzNzQ5MDJjZjgwNiwwendCUjhkRQ%3D%3D">Philips Airfryer</a>. The ad for the airfryer states that we’d endup using 80% less oil in our cooking. I was sceptical initially, especially reading some reviews which stated that the food cooked using the airfryer doesn’t taste very good.</p><p>To test this out, I grilling some fillets of basa fish, to serve with a meal for 4 people, with just over a teaspoon of oil, and it ended up tasting quite good. Since then we’ve been experimenting with other Indian recipes including Kerala Fried Fish, Chicken Kofta and other kid favorites like Homemade French Fries. All our experients turned out quite good so far, that too minus the loads of oil usually require to make these dishes.</p><h2>Sleep</h2><p>The other major change I’ve had to consciously make is to get to bed early so to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night. Lack of sleep is a killer - literally! The years of sleeping 6 hours or less through the week finally caught up with my health. Going to bed early took some getting used to - with me waking up at odd hours of the night for the first few weeks. Now it looks like my sleep cycles have finally settled now.</p><h2>Stress</h2><p>I’ve been attempting to avoid stressful situations as far as possible, since I read that stress slows down the recovery process. The folks at work have been really supportive and have allowed me to work on stuff which doesn’t put me in stressful situations. I’m also going to work only a few days of the week, while I slowly ramp up.</p><p>This has permitted me to dedicate more time with something I’ve been neglecting over the past few years - my Family.</p><h2>Family</h2><p>While earlier my priorities have been skewed mostly towards work, after escaping death, I’ve realised that my family should be my highest priority. I’ve been spending more time at home interacting with the kids - getting involved in their free time activities and helping them during their study time (or at least trying to).</p><p>The person most affected by all this is my wife, her workload has increased since last month. She’s had to single handedly manage most of the work on her own. As my condition slowly improves, I’m trying to ease her work load out by helping out with some of the chores like cooking and other odds and ends.</p><h2>What else?</h2><p>With some of the free time, I’ve been catching up with my reading and <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rdio.com%2Fpeople%2FVinuThomas%2F&amp;t=MDllNzIzZTBlNzRjN2UyOGNhNzNmMmJhY2M4NTU2ZGI2NzkzN2Y5NiwwendCUjhkRQ%3D%3D">music</a>. What I should get back to is playing the keyboard; that’s something I’ve not done in a real long time.</p><p>It’s been a challenging month trying to consciously make these changes in my life and lifestyle, and I thank all my friends, family and colleges who are helping me in my journey.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="21"><h1>Second Lease of Life</h1><p>Earlier this month, I went though an experience which was life changing.

I sat for a few minutes to see if that would settle down, but I found the discomfort increasing, and my hands started trembling.

<p>After the duty doctor at the causality ward took an <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FElectrocardiography&amp;t=N2EyMTZlMmFiZWQyNmFkOWIxZGQzYjZlZGNlNjgxOGJmYzdmMzExNyx2VE5aRm9qcw%3D%3D">EGC</a>, they asked me to quickly see the cardiologist who was (luckily) available for consultation. One look at the report, the cardiologist quickly did an echo test to confirm that I was having a heart attack. He quickly asked the folks to get me on some oxygen and meds to stabilise the heart.</p><p>I was shifted to <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fortishealthcare.com%2Findia%2Fhospitals-in-karnataka%2Ffortis-hospital-cunningham-road&amp;t=ZjgwMzEyNGRhM2VjZjY2MjVhYmM0NTA4YjNjYzc1ZDQ1NmU2MWI5MSx2VE5aRm9qcw%3D%3D">Fortis at Cunningham Road</a> immediately, where they performed an <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAngiography&amp;t=YzgyMDFhMWI5NTY2MTE0NzFlYWQ2NWFkM2ZhMGJjZWFlNTRmODEyNyx2VE5aRm9qcw%3D%3D">angiogram</a> to investigate the cause of the attack.

All was fine after this procedure and I had to stay in the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCoronary_care_unit&amp;t=ZDI0MTBkYzkxNTgyOGY2YWNhOTIwZGU4YmMyYWFiNDAyYTFmZjA3Mix2VE5aRm9qcw%3D%3D">CCU</a> till the next procedure. Since phones and gadgets were banned in the CCU and I was allowed visitors only during a few hours in the morning and evening, that was a long two days and nights! I had trouble falling asleep with all the different monitoring machines making their electronic noises through the day and night.</p><p>Finally Monday morning comes and they take me in for the second session of Angioplasty to open up the last block. This procedure went through successfully much quicker that the first and I was back in the CCU in around an hour.</p><p>Back in the CCU, they were just finishing hooking me up to the monitoring machines, when I felt dizzy and I developed tunnel vision which was increasingly getting worse by the second.. I shouted out (or tried to) that I was going under. The next thing I remember after this is my lungs burning up with the lack of air and gasping for breath, and the noise a defibrillator going off. I gathered later that the doctors managed to get my heart started up after CPR and multiple shocks. 15-20 minutes after they stabilised me, I went down one more time before coming back to the world of the living. </p><picture>

<p>I had to spend a few more days in the CCU for monitoring, which were again some of the longest days I’ve had spent, constantly looking up at the monitoring systems when ever it threw up a weird noise. Well, the rest my stay was quite uneventful, and I was discharged after four more days of close observation.</p><p>While talking with my doctor later, I found that some of the complications which could occur during or after an angioplasty is a heart attack - it usually happens only to 3-5% of patients. I must have added a minor decimal to that statistic.</p><p>Some of the folks who came to know about this incident were asking why they weren’t informed earlier, for one I didn’t have access to my phone for more than a week, and my family and I needed some rest to recuperate the week after. Now I’m recovering back home; getting a lot of rest, under a strict diet (which still leaves me craving for my regular fare), and I have a task of re-evaluating my lifestyle and priorities.</p><p>What’s my resolutions?</p><ul><li>Well for starters, a better diet and getting enough sleep.</li><li>Spending more time with the kids and family.</li><li>Focussing on doing things I like and scale back on doing some of the things I do for obligations.</li><li>Spend another week to add to this list :)</li></ul><p>I do have to thank the cardiologists who treated and performed the procedures, the alert duty doctors and staff at the Fortis Hospital CCU whose quick actions have allowed me a second lease of life.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="22"><!-- react-empty: 23 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title  text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="Component p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--graphical max-w-768px p-1 m-h-a" data-reactid="26"><a class="" data-reactid="27"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="28"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="29"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cb13a8f5af9b46eb413932b98313c712/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb6574c9d-3cdd-4413-8ff8-d022235b80ef.jpg&amp;width=1080" style="object-position:60.83984375% 95.01953125%;" data-reactid="30"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cb13a8f5af9b46eb413932b98313c712/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb6574c9d-3cdd-4413-8ff8-d022235b80ef.jpg&amp;width=1080" style="object-position:60.83984375% 95.01953125%;" data-reactid="31"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/27ce6da56b753e1a8bda4f73d1fe26b8/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb6574c9d-3cdd-4413-8ff8-d022235b80ef.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:60.83984375% 95.01953125%;" data-reactid="32"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cee04a1fcd643f8959bbfceb3cb6c218/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb6574c9d-3cdd-4413-8ff8-d022235b80ef.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:60.83984375% 95.01953125%;" data-reactid="33"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cb13a8f5af9b46eb413932b98313c712/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb6574c9d-3cdd-4413-8ff8-d022235b80ef.jpg&amp;width=1080" style="object-position:60.83984375% 95.01953125%;" data-reactid="34"/></picture></div></a><!-- react-empty: 35 --><!-- react-empty: 36 --><div class="max-w-560px m-t-1" data-reactid="37"><!-- react-text: 38 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="39"><p data-reactid="40">Found this ancient BlackBerry when I was clearing my gadget closet today.
