# On Parenting

It's tough being a parent, not knowing if we're bringing up our kids right. If we're teaching them right and allowing them to attain their full potential. Keeping them happy is a full time job for which you don't get time at all if we don't get your work-parenting balance right.

As parents we're not alone. Here are some words of wisdom from parents who've been there and done that.

> Never do for a child what he is capable of doing for himself. - _Elizabeth Hainstock_
